            <h3>Escaped king cobra crawls back to Swedish terrarium</h3>
            <p>
              HELSINKI (AP) — A venomous 2.2-meter (7 foot) king cobra that
              escaped from its home in a Swedish zoo has returned back home by
              itself, bringing a happy ending to over a week-long disappearance
              saga.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Houdini, as we named him, has crawled back into his terrarium,”
              CEO Jonas Wahlstrom of the Skansen Aquarium told the Swedish
              public broadcaster SVT on Sunday. The deadly snake, whose official
              name is Sir Vass (Sir Hiss), escaped on Oct. 22 via a light
              fixture in the ceiling of its glass enclosure at the aquarium,
              part of the zoo at the Skansen open-air museum and park on
              Stockholm’s Djurgarden island.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of an intensive search with X-ray machines, “Houdini”
              was located earlier this week in a confined space near the
              terrarium in the insulation between two walls. Holes were drilled
              into the walls where the snake was hiding but the cobra
              disappeared from the view of the X-ray cameras in the early
              Sunday. It turned out the snake had given up its freedom ride and
              crawled back to its terrarium. “It was too stressful for Houdini
              with all the holes in the walls, so he wanted to go home again,”
              Wahlstrom told SVT. The park said the snake wouldn’t have survived
              the cold climate if had gotten out of the building. King cobras
              can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) long and mainly live in India,
              Indonesia and the Philippines.

            <h3>That's scary: Roaches spoil Halloween on suburban street</h3>
            <p>
              WYANDOTTE, Mich. (AP) — Trick-or-treating is off limits in a
              suburban Detroit neighborhood: There’s nothing sweet about
              bringing home a cockroach. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach
              infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a
              trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street.
              City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent
              “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching
              a ride on costumes, the Detroit Free Press reported. The city is
              trying to exterminate the roaches but “it will take some time,”
              Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches,
              but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member
              Todd Hanna said.

            <h3>Swiss claim record for world's longest passenger train</h3>
            <p>
              GENEVA (AP) — A Swiss railway company claimed the record for the
              world’s longest passenger train Saturday with a trip on one of the
              most spectacular tracks through the Alps. The Rhaetian Railway
              company ran the 1.9-kilometer-long (1.2-mile-long) train composed
              of 100 coaches along the Albula/Bernina route from Preda to
              Berguen.
            </p>

            <p>
              The route was designated a UNESCO World Heritage in 2008 and leads
              through 22 tunnels, some of which spiral through mountains, and
              across 48 bridges, including the curved Landwasser Viaduct. The
              entire journey took over an hour. Rail enthusiasts lined the
              valley to watch the train’s 25 sections wind their way about 25
              kilometers (15.5 miles) through the Alps. Rhaetian Railway
              director Renato Fasciati said the record attempt was intended to
              highlight some of Switzerland’s engineering achievements and to
              celebrate 175 years of Swiss railways.
